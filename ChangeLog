	is now called gtk_card_deck_options_edit) without the dependence
	on having a notebook to fit into. Also used 2.0 API rather than
	the 1.x one. I have also removed the "dirty" call since it was in
	the way and we should be responding to the "changed" signal
	anyway.

2003-06-07  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* src/menu.cpp:

	dialog so that rules should be mostly self documented.  Also
	removed unused functions and HIGified alerts.

	* data/Vegas_Strip.rules: Change to allow double after split,
	surrender, and resplitting aces.  This should not affect the
	cached rules file.

2003-06-03  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* src/dialog.cpp:
	* src/game.cpp:
	* src/hand.cpp:
	* src/menu.cpp:
	* src/player.cpp:
	* src/blackjack.cpp:
	* src/events.cpp: Fixes to remove compiler warnings.  Also made
	i18n changes as per Christian Rose's suggestions. Also removed
	score stuff since it isn't used.

    * [gdk-card-image]: Added new pixmaps, including the
	spectacular Dondorf set. Originally from the PySol program.

	* README: Updated for 2.3.3

2003-06-02  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* src/events.cpp: Improved appbar text tips shown when hovering
	over objects in playing area.

2003-06-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* src/chips.cpp: If we're going to use sqrt, we'd better include
	math.h.

2003-05-16  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Trying to solve multi-platform build problems
	by using generic glib functions (and thereby making it glib's
	problem to try and figure out whether to include dirent.h or
	not). This should fix bug #111225 and several others.

2003-05-14  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* [gdk-card-image]: Added a generic card game icon (it had been floating
	around the gnome-desktop module and needed a new home).

2003-05-13  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gdk-card-image.h: Added C++ guards so that C++ code can use
	it. Do I have something in mind ? No of course not, there is no
	blackjack game that needs C++ support.

2003-05-07  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Hopefully the ifdefs are a bit more friendly
	to NetBSD and don't break anything else. Hopefully resolves bug
	#111225.

2003-04-06  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Don't use #elif for Sun. Thanks to Rick
	Burridge, closing #109988.

2003-02-24  Theo van Klaveren  <t.vanklaveren@student.utwente.nl>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Include <sys/types.h> if it is present.
	Conditionally include <dirent.h> on FreeBSD. Kludgey, but I can't
	think of any other way. Fixes compile on FreeBSD. Closes #106963.

2002-07-04  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Bad hacky mojo to fix building on OSF/1
	(closes #77903).

2002-06-05  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* gdk-card-image.c: (gdk_card_deck_dir_search),
	(gdk_card_deck_file_load): make sure it works if freecell isn't
	installed in the libgnome prefix

2002-04-16  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* gdk-card-image.c: (is_image): revert previous change about gnome-vfs
	and include gnome-vfs-mime.h header

2002-04-16  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* gdk-card-image.c: (gdk_card_deck_get_type), (is_image):
	* gdk-card-image.h: fix headers and use proper gnome-vfs function,
	use a GtkType instead of a guint for gdk_card_get_type
	(Closes: #77902)

2001-12-16  Juan Pablo Mendoza <jpablo@gnome.org>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Fix bad formated comment.

2001-07-07  Juan Pablo Mendoza <pablo_juan@yahoo.com>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Killed Imlib.

Tue Feb 06 16:51:19 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdk-card-image.c: Deal with errors and missing files/directories
	  correctly.  Use gnome-mime instead of g_is_image_filename to
	  avoid warning.

1999-02-20  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* gdk-card-image.c: limited the number of cards available
	for small and medium suit vals.
	(make_suit): remove small image from joker -- just 2 black jokers
	and 2 red jokers instead.

1998-12-08  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gdk-card-image.c (gdk_imlib_rotate_image_180): Small fix to the
	new imlib api.  This should not be poking with Imlib internals in
	the first place.

Sat Nov 21 Felix Bellaby <felix@pooh.u-net.com>
	* gdk-card-image.h: Redsigned to use gdk objects, now offers a
 	gtknotebook page for selecting card preferences.
	* gdk-card-image.c: Substantially rewritten.
	* *.png: png based images to replace xpm.

Mon Oct 26 Felix Bellaby <felix@pooh.u-net.com>
	* gdk-card-image.h (gdk_card_image_unref): frees X server refs.
	* gdk-card-image.h (gdk_card_image_back): returns a card back image.
	* gdk-card-image.h (gdk_card_image_{face/mask}): simpler, quicker API.
	* gdk-card-image.c: Brought geometry of images closer to "real" cards.
	Switched to using imlib. Doubled the corner symbols.
	* Cardback{1-5}.xpm: Added masks to card back xpms.
	* Suits.xpm, Pictures.xpm: New xpms for the cards
	* Suits.xpat.xpm, Pictures.xpat.xpm: Reformated versions of old xpms.
