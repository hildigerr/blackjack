All bugs.

General:
        - Make games respond to the gconf key change signals.
        - Move more common code into the libgames-support library.
        - Make as much as possible scalable so we can have full-screen
          modes. (80204)
        - Seriously look at a11y for actually playing the games.
        - Make games playable by keyboard (126284)
        - Look at network multi-player.
        - Consider how to handle the whole game seed thing.
	- Update debian files to be reasonable

Blackjack:
        - Eliminate the splash screen (and hopefully any recalculation).
        - Multiplayer (129639)
        - Training mode (129638)
        - Rules dialog clean-up (124613)

libgames-support:
	- Widgets other than the combo box for the GamesFileList.
	- GamesFileList standard directory option for paths.
	- Make a shared library. Rename to libgnome-games
        - Document
	- Use a second thread for pre-generating card images (I think
          this was shaunm's idea so he could take advantage of works' dual
	  opteron).


Make keys configurable?
