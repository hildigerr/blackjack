2.5 Issues

General:
        - Make games respond to the gconf key change signals.
        - Move more common code into the libgames-support library.
        - Make as much as possible scalable so we can have full-screen
          modes.
        - Seriously look at a11y for actually playing the games.
        - Make games playable by keyboard (126284)
        - Look at network multi-player.
        - Consider how to handle the whole game seed thing.
	- Update debian files to be reasonable

Blackjack:
        - Eliminate the splash screen (and hopefully any recalculation).
        - Multiplayer (129639)
        - Training mode (129638)
        - Resetting the balance (124629)
        - Rules dialog clean-up (124613)

libgames-support:
	- Widgets other than the combo box for the GamesFileList.
	- GamesFileList standard directory option for paths.
        - Document

gdk-card-image:
	- When a "custom" style is used make sure that there is no selection.
 	  Currently the default is selected, this may be a limit in the GtkTreeView
	  widget.
        - Document


Make keys configurable?
