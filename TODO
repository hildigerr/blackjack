2.5 Issues

General:
        - Make games respond to the gconf key change signals.
        - Move more common code into the libgames-support library.
        - Make as much as possible scalable so we can have full-screen
          modes.
        - Seriously look at a11y for actually playing the games.
        - Look at network multi-player.
        - Consider how to handle the whole game seed thing.
	- Update debian files to be reasonable

Blackjack:
        - Eliminate the splash screen (and hopefully any recalculation).

gdk-card-image:
	- Make card-styles.xml generated so we can do i18n.
	- When a "custom" style is used make sure that there is no selection.
 	  Currently the default is selected, this may be a limit in the GtkTreeView
	  widget.

Make keys configurable?
