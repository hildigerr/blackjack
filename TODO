General 2.4 cleanups:

1. Documentation cleanup: version numbers, completeness and make sure
   they actually work.
2. GConf, make sure it is sane, works and accepts bad input gracefully.
3. HIG compliant preferences
4. Menu item sensitivity, undo, redo, hint, solve, etc.
5. Remove the quit dialog.
6. Builds without warnings (make sure they are enabled).

Y = OK., N = probably needs work, P = partial, ? = maybe,
lower case letter = note. - = not applicable

These should all become yes or have a good reason why not.

                1.      2.      3.      4.      5.      6.

a) The preference and select dialogs are compliant, but there is
   debate about whether it is good UI. For the moment this counts as
   a "good reason" since it really isn't high priority compared with
   every other 2.4 issue.

2.4 Issues

Blackjack:
        - Whatever the UI review says.

2.5 Issues

General:
        - Make games respond to the gconf key change signals.
        - Move more common code into the libgames-support library.
        - Make as much as possible scalable so we can have full-screen
          modes.
        - Seriously look at a11y for actually playing the games.
        - Look at network multi-player.
        - Consider how to handle the whole game seed thing.

Blackjack:
        - Eliminate the splash screen (and hopefully any recalculation).


Make keys configurable?
