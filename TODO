2.5 Issues

General:
        - Make games respond to the gconf key change signals.
        - Move more common code into the libgames-support library.
        - Make as much as possible scalable so we can have full-screen
          modes.
        - Seriously look at a11y for actually playing the games.
        - Look at network multi-player.
        - Consider how to handle the whole game seed thing.
	- Update debian files to be reasonable

Blackjack:
        - Eliminate the splash screen (and hopefully any recalculation).

gdk-card-image:
        - Document


Make keys configurable?
