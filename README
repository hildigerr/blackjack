!!! IMPORTANT !!!

Migrating from 2.6 to 2.7.

The 2.7 series of gnome-games is a development version and has some
quite radical changes which will undoubtedly produce bugs. All bugs
should of course be reported to http://bugzilla.gnome.org/

========================================================================

Overview
--------

Gnome-games is a collection of simple, but addictive, games from the
GNOME desktop project. They represent many of the popular games and
include card games, puzzle games and arcade games. They are meant to
be the sort of game that can be played in five minutes or so. They are
also meant to be fun enough that you will play them again and
again. Of course we can't be held responsible for the time and
productivity lost while playing them.

The Games
---------

Here is a list of the games in this compilation along with a brief
description. The names in brackets are the program names you use from the
command line.

Blackjack       The casino card game without any need to actually pay
                your gambling debts. (blackjack)

Mailing List
------------

Gnome-games has a mailing list at <games-list@gnome.org>. You can
subscribe to the list at:

 http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/games-list

and browse the archives at:

 http://mail.gnome.org/archives/games-list/

The mailing list is for announcements and discussion about games
written for the GNOME environment. It is moderated and low volume.

Maintainers
-----------

The current maintainers are:

 Callum McKenzie <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>.
 Jon McCann <mccann@jhu.edu>.

While you can email them with suggestions and bug reports it is better
to use either the bug tracking system (see below) or the mailing
list. Even for suggestions the bug tracking system is better because
it ensures that there is an archive of the discussion and it is harder
for the maintainer to loose suggestions. For more general discussion,
policy issues and issues that many people will be interested in, the
mailing list is the best place.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

If you find any bugs in gnome-games, or even just have a suggestion
for an improvement to the games then please submit a bug report. There
are two ways to do this, either by using the web-based interface to
the GNOME bug tracking system at

http://bugs.gnome.org/simple-bug-guide.cgi

or use the bug reporting tool, which you can find under the Development
sub-menu of the GNOME menu. The bug reporting tool can also be launched
from the command line via the bug-buddy command.

If a game crashes then the bug reporting tool will be automatically
launched.

There is one problem with the standard bug reporting tools and
gnome-games. Because gnome-games uses setgid bit to give the programs
extra privileges the ordinary bug reporting tools don't do a complete
job because a stack trace cannot be made. Stack traces are very useful
in determining what went wrong. To get a proper stack trace with
gnome-games binaries then you should try and recreate your crash while
running as the root use, or, with the setgid bit temporarily removed
from the file. Both these require root privileges which you may not
have.

Requirements
------------

To compile these packages you need at least the baseline GNOME 2.4
development packages. You really, really, need GTK+ 2.3. You also need
gettext 0.12 or newer. If you are building from CVS then you also need
the CVS version of intltool.

In addition it is useful to have a working C++ compiler (e.g. g++,
part of the gcc suite).


Building Gnome-Games
--------------------


Security Issues
---------------

It might seem a little strange that a collection of games needs to
talk about security issues, but it all stems from an attempt to avoid
cheating.

The Future
----------

The 2.6 release of gnome-games has been an incremental improvement
over 2.4. 2.8 will be a similar incremental improvement. Once again I
hope to concentrate on only a few games to bring them kicking and
screaming into the 21st century. The following goals are still
important in the long run:
 - Making it easier for individual players to introduce their own themes.
 - Scalability of the game graphics so that the game can be resized
   to suit the player.
 - Networking.
