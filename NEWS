gnome-games "Reasonable Excuse" 2.4.0
=====================================

This is it folks, the big one.

Since 2.3.90 there have been updates to Greek, Slovak, Norwegian,
Catalan, Italian and Brazilian Portugese.

gnome-games "Final Warning" 2.3.90
==================================

More translation updates: da, fi, hi, cy, es, fr, fi and an update to
the README file to explain what has changed between 2.2 and 2.4

This is a release candidate, the only expected changes between this and the
final 2.4.0 version will be translation updates.

gnome-games "Eden Park" 2.3.8
==============================

For most people, an even more minor update over 2.3.7. There have been
numerous translation updates including: bg, az, zh_TW, hi, no, ko, and
zh_CN. The Hindi translation is completely new.

If you are finding this frozen, stable, sort of code boring you can
find the latest 2.5 series code in CVS HEAD.

gnome-games "Carisbrook" 2.3.7
==============================

This is a minor update over 2.3.6. The only user visible changes
should be a new README file and translation updates.

There are still some bugs that it would be nice to have resolved by
2.4, if they can be reproduced. Aside from them, this is essentially
2.4.0.

gnome-games "It's For Your Own Good" 2.3.6
==========================================

This release is in theory a good facsimile of what 2.4.0 will look
like. The most obvious change will be that the documentation is now
mostly up-to-date.

gnome-games "Palm Cove" 2.3.5
=============================

This release is a little early since I'm going to be away during the
"official" release period. My location will of course be a closely
guarded secret.

gnome-games "Cruising Along" 2.3.4
==================================

Things are cruising along towards a nice, stable, 2.4 release.
This release mostly contains bug fixes and clean-ups.

A big thanks goes to Jon McCann and Steve Chaplin who have done most
of the work on this release.

The TODO file now has a complete list of what we hope to complete for
2.4 and an incomplete list of what is planned for 2.5 and beyond.

gnome-games "Shiny Things Revenge" 2.3.3
========================================

13% Fewer bugs, 15% less fat and 7% more games.

We now have a blackjack game courtesy of Jon McCann.
