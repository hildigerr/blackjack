gnome-games "Palm Cove" 2.3.5
=============================

This release is a little early since I'm going to be away during the
"official" release period. My location will of course be a closely
guarded secret.

gnome-games "Cruising Along" 2.3.4
==================================

Things are cruising along towards a nice, stable, 2.4 release.
This release mostly contains bug fixes and clean-ups.

A big thanks goes to Jon McCann and Steve Chaplin who have done most
of the work on this release.

The TODO file now has a complete list of what we hope to complete for
2.4 and an incomplete list of what is planned for 2.5 and beyond.

gnome-games "Shiny Things Revenge" 2.3.3
========================================

13% Fewer bugs, 15% less fat and 7% more games.

We now have a blackjack game courtesy of Jon McCann.
