gnome-games 2.7.8
=================

This release is ready for the code-freeze. It contains only
bug-fixes. One more release with documentation updates and any
emergency bug-fixes can be expected before 2.8.0.

Bug fixes:

Blackjack:
 - The payout for winning with a blackjack is now documented.
 - The SVG chip images have been cleaned up and should work with most
   versions of librsvg.

gnome-games 2.7.7
=================

In the shuffling of themes, Richard Hoelscher's "Paris" SVG card theme
has crept into the main distribution. It uses the same source of
inspiration as David Bellot's SVG card deck, but is smaller and less
detailed, making it faster to load.

gnome-games 2.7.6
=================

Only one new item that should grab your attention: David Bellot's pure
SVG card theme. Be warned that this theme is complex and is liable to
expose speed issue and rendering bugs. These aren't David's fault,
they're mine.

gnome-games 2.7.5
=================

This is the last release before the feature freeze.

Blackjack:
 - SVG chip and slot images.

gnome-games 2.7.4
=================

Blackjack:
 - Replace deprecated widgets (Jon McCann)

gnome-games 2.7.3
=================

 - Removed gdk-card-images library (callum)
 - Drawing fixes for blackjack (callum)

gnome-games 2.7.2
=================

The major change for this release is Jon McCann's work on
his blackjack game to make is rescalable. There are some
known bugs in this (due to Callum's code, not Jon's) so be
careful. Those who are reading this as part of the first
official GNOME 2.7 release probably want to look at the notes
for 2.7.1 too.

gnome-games 2.7.1
=================

This is the first release of the new development cycle and there is a
*lot* of very new features available for your enjoyment. Being a
development release there will also be a lot of bugs. As always we are
very interested in bug reports and suggestions: send them to:

                   http://bugzilla.gnome.org/

Gnome-games now has a web-page. You can find it at:

            http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnome-games/

gnome-games "Thank you and Good Night" 2.6.1
============================================

Bug fixes for blackjack. Translation updates for
Hungarian and Gujarati. What more could you ask from a stable
release ?

gnome-games "Space Monster Redux" 2.6.0.1
=========================================

An minor update over 2.6.1, this is to take advantage of the
extra translation work done due to the delayed release.

gnome-games "Space Monster" 2.6.0
=================================

This is the new stable release of gnome-games.

Many people have contributed to this release, both for code and
artwork. In alphabetical order they are:
 Steve Chaplin,
 Richard Hoelscher,
 John McCann
 Callum McKenzie,
 Tim Musson,
 Rexford Newbould,
 Krzysztof Foltman,
 Gonzalo Odiard,

You will need the GNOME 2.6 development platform to build this,
especially GTK 2.3. It is also desirable to have gettext 0.12. To
compile Blackjack you need a C++ compiler.

gnome-games "Zero Gravitas" 2.5.9
=================================

This is also a release candidate. Naturally there was a
brown-paper-bag bug discovered the day after the last release. This
has been fixed. Also, the credits have been updated and of course
there have been more translations (does the translation team never
sleep ?!).

gnome-games "Sacrificial Victim" 2.5.8
======================================

This is the release candidate for 2.6. In an ideal world there would be
no major bugs in this release. Here in the real world there will be a
brown-paper-bag bug discovered tomorrow. You could be the one to report
it and cause me hideous embarrassment ! Go ahead, you know you want
to.

Since 2.5.7 the only changes have been bug-fixes, documentation
updates and more translations.

gnome-games "Problem Child" 2.5.7
=================================

This is the long-awaited beta for 2.6. As far as I know there are no
bugs that crash any of the the games or make them unplayable. I expect
this to change once you test it and file what you find in
Bugzilla. The documentation is the only thing expected to change
before 2.6.0.

So what is new this time ?

Bug fixes.

gnome-games "Limiting Factor" 2.5.6
===================================

This release is for testing. No new features have been added since
2.5.5 but there have been a lot of bugs fixed and there is some
revised code that needs testing.

*** Now is the time ot file bug reports ! ***

If you see any bugs in this release, report them. It's too late for UI
changes (although they will be considered for 2.7) but anything that
crashes these games needs to be reported. Please try and give a
precise summary of how to reproduce the bug. Getting stack traces in
gnome-games is hard, but worth it (try running the games as the user
that installed them, e.g. root).

What other excuse do you need to play solitaire all day ?

What has changed:

- blackjack caches its calculations better. Now all game types are
cached (you should only see the progress dialog the first time you
play a rule set). Be warned that this can store up to a megabyte of
data in your home directory. Sharing of the cached files will not be
implemented for 2.6.

And of course it will crash less often.

gnome-games "The Ends of Invention" 2.5.5
=========================================

This is the feature-freeze release. This should be what 2.6 looks like
minus the bugs.

gnome-games "Irregular Apocalypse" 2.5.4
========================================

WARNING: This release is particularly buggy.

gnome-games "Revisionist" 2.5.3.1
=================================

gnome-games "The Catastrophe" 2.5.3
===================================

Finally, we know the answer to the question: can you make a
gnome-games release with a kitten balanced on each shoulder ? The
answer is yes.

blackjack: Text drawing re-write.
gdk-card-image: Improve the use of GamesFileList.
libgames-support: Improvements to GamesFileList.

gnome-games "Nervous Energy" 2.5.2
==================================

This release is evenly split between UI changes and back-end code
consolidation.

Code for locating files in gdk-card-image and glines has been merged
into the libgames-support library. More games will take advantage of
this as the (internal) API firms up.

The card selection widget in gdk-card-image has been changed. This
affects blackjack. You no longer select the details of
the card image from seven menus, instead there is one list with a set
of predefined styles. These styles are loaded from an external file
but home directories are not searched yet so custom styles require
root access. If the current style is not on the list it is not
touched, so existing preferences and direct editing of the style using
gconf-editor will work.

Blackjack has recieved some cleanup work to the UI and some bug fixes.

gnome-games "Trade Surplus" 2.5.1
====================

This is a catch-up release and unfortunately doesn't contain many sexy
new features.

Other changes:

blackjack: The keyboard controls are now documented plus some bug
           fixes and UI improvements.

gnome-games "Credibility Problem" 2.5.0
========================================

So here it is, the first release of the new unstable series of
gnome-games and quite frankly I think I've done an excellent job of
trying to make it unstable.

gnome-games "Only Slightly Bent" 2.4.1
======================================

Since 2.4.0 was so perfect we've had to release another version. There
have been several translation updates.

gnome-games "Reasonable Excuse" 2.4.0
=====================================

This is it folks, the big one.

Since 2.3.90 there have been updates to Greek, Slovak, Norwegian,
Catalan, Italian and Brazilian Portugese.

gnome-games "Final Warning" 2.3.90
==================================

More translation updates: da, fi, hi, cy, es, fr, fi and an update to
the README file to explain what has changed between 2.2 and 2.4

This is a release candidate, the only expected changes between this and the
final 2.4.0 version will be translation updates.

gnome-games "Eden Park" 2.3.8
==============================

For most people, an even more minor update over 2.3.7. There have been
numerous translation updates including: bg, az, zh_TW, hi, no, ko, and
zh_CN. The Hindi translation is completely new.

If you are finding this frozen, stable, sort of code boring you can
find the latest 2.5 series code in CVS HEAD.

gnome-games "Carisbrook" 2.3.7
==============================

This is a minor update over 2.3.6. The only user visible changes
should be a new README file and translation updates.

There are still some bugs that it would be nice to have resolved by
2.4, if they can be reproduced. Aside from them, this is essentially
2.4.0.

gnome-games "It's For Your Own Good" 2.3.6
==========================================

This release is in theory a good facsimile of what 2.4.0 will look
like. The most obvious change will be that the documentation is now
mostly up-to-date.

gnome-games "Palm Cove" 2.3.5
=============================

This release is a little early since I'm going to be away during the
"official" release period. My location will of course be a closely
guarded secret.

gnome-games "Cruising Along" 2.3.4
==================================

Things are cruising along towards a nice, stable, 2.4 release.
This release mostly contains bug fixes and clean-ups.

A big thanks goes to Jon McCann and Steve Chaplin who have done most
of the work on this release.

The TODO file now has a complete list of what we hope to complete for
2.4 and an incomplete list of what is planned for 2.5 and beyond.

gnome-games "Shiny Things Revenge" 2.3.3
========================================

13% Fewer bugs, 15% less fat and 7% more games.

We now have a blackjack game courtesy of Jon McCann.
